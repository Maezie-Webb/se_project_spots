It will let the user customize their own profile picture, name, and bio with the ease of a single edit button. After the user has perfected their profile they will be able to easily post their favorite pictures with a description, using the '+ New Post' button. Once the photos are posted, the user will see the 'likes' flow in from the simple tap of the 'heart', located after each of the picture descriptions.
